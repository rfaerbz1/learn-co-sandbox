          <h2>Scientific Contributions</h2>
          <p>In 1944 Chien-Shiung Wu joined the Manhattan Project at the lab at Columbia University, she focused on radiation detectors.</p>
          <p>After the war, Chien-Shiung Wu investigated beta decay, which is when the nucleus of one element changes into another element. She made many contributions to this field of study.</p>
